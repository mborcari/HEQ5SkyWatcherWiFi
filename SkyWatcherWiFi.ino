  Serial to WiFi adapter for Skywatcher telescopes
  This is an adapter to connect to the RJ-11 udpPort of Skywatcher telescope mounts
  and offer the serial connection as an UDP udpPort 11880 via WiFi to the Skywatcher Synscan app.

/**
    Hardware used:
    NodeMCU ESP8266 development board (version 12E) I used the HiLetgo model https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010O1G1ES 
    100 Ohm resistor
    50 Ohm resistor (or two 100 Ohm resistors in parallel)
    RJ11 Pinout:
        --- No Connection
        --- GND
        --- "TX" to a 50 Ohm resistor and then to NodeMCU's pin TX (GPIO_1)
        --- VCC 12V (to a 5V drop-down volate regulator to power the NodeMCU thrugh it's Vin pin)
        --- "RX" to a 100 Ohm resistor and then to NodeMCU's pin RX (GPIO_3)
        --- No Connection
    
    ESP8266 pinout:
     GND:  To the GND pin of the RJ11 connector (and to GND of your chosen power source)

     When not connected to a computer via USB:
     Vin:  5V~9V from any power source (you can use a step down from 12V to ~5V to power the NodeMCU from most skywatcher mounts)
     TX:   to a 50 Ohm resstor and then to the "TX" pin on the RJ11 connector
     RX:   to a 100 Ohm resistor and then to the "RX" pin on the RJ11 connector
